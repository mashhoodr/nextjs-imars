title: "Showing an alert message in iOS"

Its been a while since my last post, a lot has happened and there are several unfinished entries waiting to be published. However, this particular one is very small. I recently started developing for iOS and was looking for a way to show alert messages and I could not find a simple one line solution to my problem. I have finally figured out a way to do it, its not exactly one line, but is a single string of code, just need to replace the title and message string and you are good to go!

This may not Â be the best way to show an alert, but I felt this is the easiest one.

```objc

\[\[\[\[UIAlertView alloc\] initWithTitle:@"Title" message:@"Message" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"Ok" otherButtonTitles: nil\] autorelease\] show\];
```
